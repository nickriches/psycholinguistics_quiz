# The dual route model

According to the d`r fitb("ual", width = "15")` r`r fitb("oute", width = "15")` model, past tense verbs are generated via either a l`r fitb("exical", width = "15")` or a g`r fitb("rammatical", width = "15")` route.

The former involves an`r fitb("alogical", width = "15")` and fr`r fitb("equency", width = "15")`-driven processes, while the latter involves co`r fitb("mputational", width = "15")` processes. The former involves the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system, while the latter involves the pr `r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system.

If the pr`r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs.

If the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs.

Which of the following is NOT characterised by by better performance on irregulars than regulars? `r mcq(c("Parkinson's", answer = "Alzheimers", "Developmental Language Disorder", "Agrammatic non-fluent Aphasia (Broca's type"))`

The term ps`r fitb("eudo", width = "15")`-regularity describes the phenomenon whereby the irregular system mimics the regular system.

`r hide("Show answers")`

According to the DUAL ROUTE model, past tense verbs are generated via either a LEXICAL or a GRAMMATICAL route.

The former involves ANALOGICAL and FREQUENCY-driven processes, while the latter involves COMPUTATIONAL processes. The former involves the DECLARATIVE memory system, while the latter involves the PROCEDURAL memory system.

If the PROCEDURAL memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of IRREGULAR verbs than REGULAR verbs.

If the DECLARATIVE memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of REGULAR verbs than IRREGULAR verbs.

Which of the following is NOT characterised by by better performance on irregulars than regulars? ALZHEIMMER'S

The term PSEUDO-regularity describes the phenomenon whereby the irregular system mimics the regular system.

# Models of morphological representation

A morpheme is the smallest unit of m`r fitb("eaning", width = "12")`. Morphemes which come at the beginning or ends of words are called a`r fitb("ffixes", width = "12")`. If a word contains more than one morpheme it is m`r fitb("ulti", width = "8")`morphemic, and if it contains only one morpheme it is m`r fitb("ono", width = "8")`morphemic.

There is some debate regarding the storage of multimorphemic words. According to a`r fitb("ffix", width = "8")`-stripping accounts, morphemes in multimorphemic words are stored separately. However, according to wh`r fitb("ole", width = "8")`-entry accounts, multimorphemic words are stored as wholes.

A variety of data support w`r fitb("hole", width = "8")`-entry accounts:

(1) Reaction Times data from production and lexical d`r fitb("ecision", width = "8")` tasks, suggest that high-frequency m`r fitb("ulti", width = "8")`MORPHEMIC forms may be stored as wholes.

(2) When all affixes are stripped away, sometimes the remaining r`r fitb("oot", width = "8")` has no independent meaning, e.g. in-EVIT-able.

A variety of data support a`r fitb("ffix", width = "8")`-stripping accounts:

(1) When we hear a word we actively seek out affixes, and activate them in our lexicons, a process known as morpho`r fitb("phonological", width = "10")` p`r fitb("arsing", width = "10")`

(2) When producing words, RTs increase as the number of a`r fitb("ffixes", width = "10")` increase.

(3) Speech errors involve m`r fitb("ovement", width = "10")` of affixes from one word to another.

Finally, some have argued that there are multiple forms of storage, with affixes being represented separately or not according to the semantic tra`r fitb("nsparency", width = "8")` and f`r fitb("requency", width = "8")` of word forms. This framework is called a h`r fitb("ybrid", width = "8")` framework.

`r hide("Show answers")`

A morpheme is the smallest unit of MEANING. Morphemes which come at the beginning or ends of words are called AFFIXES. If a word contains more than one morpheme it is MULTIMORPHEMIC, and if it contains only one morpheme it is MONOMORPHEMIC

There is some debate regarding the storage of multimorphemic words. According to AFFIX-stripping accounts, morphemes in multimorphemic words are stored separately. However, according to WHOLE-entry accounts, multimorphemic words are stored as wholes.

A variety of data support WHOLE-entry accounts:

(1) Reaction Times data from production and lexical DECISION tasks, suggest that high-frequency MULTIMORPHEMIC forms may be stored as wholes.

(2) When all affixes are stripped away, sometimes the remaining ROOT has no independent meaning, e.g. in-EVIT-able.

A variety of data support AFFIX-stripping accounts:

(1) When we hear a word we actively seek out affixes, and activate them in our lexicons, a process known as morphoPHONOLOGICAL PARSING

(2) When producing words, RTs increase as the number of AFFIXES increase.

(3) Speech errors involve MOVEMENT of affixes from one word to another.

Finally, some have argued that there are multiple forms of storage, with affixes being represented separately or not according to the semantic TRANSPARENCY and FREQUENCY of word forms. This framework is called a HYBRID framework.

# The lexicon

Many but not all words are stored in semantic hierarchies with three levels, e.g. Furniture > Chair > Stool, Plant > Tree > Sycamore. The middle level is called the b`r fitb(answer = "asic", width = "10")` level. Words which exist at the same level (e.g. chair/table/bookshelf, bush/tree/flower) are called co`r fitb(answer = "hyponyms", width = "10")` or co`r fitb(answer = "ordinates", width = "10")`. The words are said to belong to the same s`r fitb(answer = "emantic", width = "8")` f`r fitb(answer = "ield", width = "10")`. Words at a higher level are called hyp`r fitb(answer = "eronyms", width = "10")` or sup`r fitb(answer = "erordinates", width = "10")`, while words at a lower level are called hyp`r fitb(answer = "onyms", width = "10")` or sub`r fitb(answer = "ordinates", width = "10")`. Words in the middle (the b`r fitb(answer = "asic", width = "10")` level) are more strongly represented in memory: they are easier to v`r fitb(answer = "isualise", width = "10")` and more rapidly n`r fitb(answer = "amed", width = "10")`. There are also links between words which tend to co-occur. Words tend to occur next to each other are called co`r fitb(answer = "llocations", width = "10")`, and words which tend to co-occur in the same chunk (phrase or sentence), but not next to each other are sometimes called ass`r fitb(answer = "ociates", width = "10")`

In word association tasks the most common response is `r mcq(c("superordinates", "subordinates", answer = "coordinates", "collocations/associates"))`, followed by `r mcq(c("superordinates", "subordinates", "coordinates", answer = "collocations/associates"))`. Word association reponses of children with Developmental Language Disorders is characterised by `r mcq(c("more", answer = "fewer"))` semantic relationships, e.g. superordinates. 

Blending errors, e.g. expect + suppose -> suppose, demonstrate (a) p`r fitb(answer = "arallel", width = "10")` a`r fitb(answer = "ctivation", width = "10")`, (b) activation across do`r fitb(answer = "mains", width = "10")`, (c) the existence of a lexical m `r fitb(answer = "onitor", width = "10")` which minimises the possibility of nonword errors.

T`r fitb(answer = "ip", width = "8")`-o`r fitb(answer = "f", width = "8")`-t`r fitb(answer = "he", width = "8")`-t`r fitb(answer = "ongue", width = "8")` studies demonstrate that phonological representations may be p`r fitb(answer = "artially", width = "8")`-activated. The b`r fitb(answer = "athtub", width = "8")` effect refers to phenomenon whereby the beginnings and endings of words are more strongly represented.

`r hide("Show answers")`

Many but not all words are stored in semantic hierarchies with three levels, e.g. Furniture > Chair > Stool, Plant > Tree > Sycamore. The middle level is called the BASIC level. Words which exist at the same level (e.g. chair/table/bookshelf, bush/tree/flower) are called COHYPONYMS or COORDINATES. The words are said to belong to the same SEMANTIC FIELD. Words at a higher level are called HYPERONYMS or SUPERORDINATES, while words at a lower level are called HYPONYMS or SUBORDINATES. Words in the middle (the BASIC level) is more strongly represented in memory: they are easier to VISUALISE and more rapidly NAMED. There are also links between words which tend to co-occur. Words tend to co-occur are called COLLOCATIONS, and words which tend to co-occur in the same chunk (phrase or sentence), but not next to each other are sometimes called ASSOICATES.

In word association tasks the most common response is COORDINATES, followed by COLLOCATIONS/ASSOCIATES. Word association reponses of children with Developmental Language Disorders is characterised by FEWER semantic relationships, e.g. superordinates. 

Blending errors, e.g. expect + suppose -> suppose, demonstrate (a) PARALLEL ACTIVATION, (b) activation across DOMAINS, (c) the existence of a lexical MONITOR which minimises the possibility of nonword errors.

TIP-OF-THE TONGUE studies demonstrate that phonological representations may be PARTIALLY activated. The BATHTUB effect refers to phenomenon whereby the beginnings and endings of words are more strongly represented.
