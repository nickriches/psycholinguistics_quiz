# The dual route model

According to the d`r fitb("ual", width = "15")` r`r fitb("oute", width = "15")` model, past tense verbs are generated via either a l`r fitb("exical", width = "15")` or a g`r fitb("rammatical", width = "15")` route.

The former involves an`r fitb("alogical", width = "15")` and fr`r fitb("equency", width = "15")`-driven processes, while the latter involves co`r fitb("mputational", width = "15")` processes. The former involves the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system, while the latter involves the pr `r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system.

If the pr`r fitb("ocedural", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs.

If the de`r fitb("clarative", width = "15")` memory system is impaired, this will result in better production of `r mcq(c(answer = "regular", "irregular"))` verbs than `r mcq(c("regular", answer = "irregular"))` verbs.

Which of the following is NOT characterised by by better performance on irregulars than regulars? `r mcq(c("Parkinson's", answer = "Alzheimers", "Developmental Language Disorder", "Agrammatic non-fluent Aphasia (Broca's type"))`

The term ps`r fitb("eudo", width = "15")`-regularity describes the phenomenon whereby the irregular system mimics the regular system.
